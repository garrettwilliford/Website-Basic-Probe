When running my website, I noticed I was getting hundreds of ip's that didnt do much besides hit the main server.
After some research I concluded a majorty of them were automated bots logging my website. However, some ips were operating under
personal vpn subscriptions. And of those, many of them were looking for things like
1. Wordpress Login Pages
2. Azure cloud rules
3. Hidden files/.bash history

They were looking for vunerabilities in my website. I compiled a list of these I belive to be malicious, and created a simple python script
that one would use when probing a website.
